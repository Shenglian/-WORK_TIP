Research shows that expanding effort on remembering things reduces our attention

impairs our decision-making abilities 

I smugly dismissed to-do lists. 

they’ve since become an integral part of my workflows

they should be a canonical representation of our work

A single master list is better than an assortment of sticky notes, sheets of paper, and emails.

because these scattered alternatives are easily misplaced and make it harder for your brain to trust that they’re comprehensive
Having the master list easily accessible allows you quickly identify a task you can complete if you unexpectedly have a block of free time

you can add it directly to your list even when you’re out and about, rather than investing mental energy in trying to remember it.

When you consistently offload to-dos to your list 

our team brainstormed hundreds of ideas for how we might increase product usage and engagement. 

The next two sections present two heuristics that can help 

an inevitable lesson learned is that the time and effort expended do not necessarily correlate with the value produced
activity is not necessarily production

These tasks only have a weak and indirect connection to creating value 

what matters is how much value you’ve created. at value is measured in terms of products shipped 

We’re inundated every day with urgent requests demanding our attention: meetings, emails, phone calls, bugs, pager duty alerts, the next deadline. 

we also need to prioritize the investments that increase our ability to be more effective and deliver more value in the future

I consistently give my mentees is to carve out time to invest in skills development 

Engineers need longer and more contiguous blocks of time to be productive than many other professionals 

The number of projects that you can work on simultaneously varies from person to person. Use trial and error to figure out how many projects you can work on before quality and momentum drop, and resist the urge to work on too many projects at once. 

Sometimes, what hinders focus isn’t a lack of contiguous time or too much context switching. Instead, many people do not have sufficient motivation to summon the activation energy required to start a difficult task.

> used to
```
用來表示過去經常做的行為，但現在不在發生了
使用方法： used to + V (動詞原型)
其中的 to 是不定詞，而不是介係詞，所以後面只能接動詞原型。

【肯定句】He used to smoke.  他過去常抽菸。
【否定句】1. 直接在 used 後面加上 not, He used not to smoke.
【否定句】2. 使用助動詞 didn’t，這種用法就是把 used 當成動詞看待，所以變成否定句要用助動詞, He didn’t use to smoke.
【一般疑問句】把 did 放在句首 Did he use to smoke?
【反問疑問句】He used to smoke, didn’t he?
```

> be used to
```
【第一種用法】
描述物品被用來做某件事情。
使用方法：物 + be used to + V (動詞原型)
這裡的 used 是 use 的被動語態，而 to 是不定詞，後面要加動詞原型。
e.g., Tom is used to noise.  湯姆習慣於噪音。

【第二種用法】
指人習慣於某樣東西或某件事。
使用方法：人 + be used to + Ving (動名詞) / N (名詞)
這裡的 to 是介係詞，所以後面要加動名詞或名詞。
e.g., Tom is used to living in a noisy street.  湯姆習慣居住於嘈雜的街道。
```

> get used to
```
表示從「不習慣」到「習慣」的過程，意思是變得習慣於、開始習慣於某件事或物。
使用方法：人 + get used to + Ving (動名詞) / N (名詞)

e.g., Since Tom moved to that street, he has gotten used to noise.        自從湯姆搬到那條街道，他已經變得習慣於噪音。
e.g., Tom wasn’t used to noise. It took him some time to get used to it.  湯姆之前不習慣於噪音環境，他花了點時間才開始習慣。
```

> Lady: no, thank you. I'd like to drive my car to school alone.
我想開我的車上學
(婉轉 已經習慣有禮貌的說話方式, 不爽時也用禮貌性口氣)

> Girl: no, thanks. I wanna drive my car to school alone.
我想開我的車上學
(非常直接) 


> Gonna 將要
Gonna 就是 Going to

I’m gonna go home. 我要回家了
I’m going to go home. (當然不會有人這樣說)

> Wanna 想要
Wanna 就是Want to 想要

所以像辣妹合唱團的《Wanna be》歌詞中：
If you wanna be my lover, you have got to give.
如果想當我情人，你要懂得付出。

> Gotta 必須
Gotta就是 (I’ve) got to

I gotta go.

我得走了
