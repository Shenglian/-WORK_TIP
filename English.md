Research shows that expanding effort on remembering things reduces our attention

impairs our decision-making abilities 

I smugly dismissed to-do lists. 

they’ve since become an integral part of my workflows

they should be a canonical representation of our work

A single master list is better than an assortment of sticky notes, sheets of paper, and emails.

because these scattered alternatives are easily misplaced and make it harder for your brain to trust that they’re comprehensive
Having the master list easily accessible allows you quickly identify a task you can complete if you unexpectedly have a block of free time

you can add it directly to your list even when you’re out and about, rather than investing mental energy in trying to remember it.

When you consistently offload to-dos to your list 

our team brainstormed hundreds of ideas for how we might increase product usage and engagement. 

The next two sections present two heuristics that can help 

an inevitable lesson learned is that the time and effort expended do not necessarily correlate with the value produced
activity is not necessarily production
 These tasks only have a weak and indirect connection to creating value 

what matters is how much value you’ve created. at value is measured in terms of products shipped 

We’re inundated every day with urgent requests demanding our attention: meetings, emails, phone calls, bugs, pager duty alerts, the next deadline. 

we also need to prioritize the investments that increase our ability to be more effective and deliver more value in the future

I consistently give my mentees is to carve out time to invest in skills development 

Engineers need longer and more contiguous blocks of time to be productive than many other professionals 

The number of projects that you can work on simultaneously varies from person to person. Use trial and error to figure out how many projects you can work on before quality and momentum drop, and resist the urge to work on too many projects at once. 

Sometimes, what hinders focus isn’t a lack of contiguous time or too much context switching. Instead, many people do not have sufficient motivation to summon the activation energy required to start a difficult task.
